## Features

On the App you can :

    - Add a new task
    - Delete complete tasks
    - Mark tasks as complete
    - Saved in local storage, you can load it later !

## Technologies used

    This project is an initiation to learn React.
    So i used React for building the app. And a pinch of CSS for styling.

In React i used :

- The uuid/v4 library for generating unique IDs
- useState, useRef & useEffect for managing the state of the app

## How to start a new React Project ?

    - Create a new repo on Github
    - Clone the repo on your computer
    - Open the project in your editor
    - Run the command `npx create-react-app my-app` (if you want to call your project `my-app`)
    - Then cd into the folder `my-app`
    - Run the command `npm start` to open the app in your browser
    - Run `npm run build` to build the app for production
    - Enjoy !
